How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you
see that bug that was introduced?

It helped me compare the two files line by line. Since the
diff command clearly marked the lines that were added. I was 
able to go through the newly added lines and thus quickly find
the error. This allowed to save time, as I would have had to
go through each line in each file manually to compare the
differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Having the history of a file help a programmer log the
evolution of a program. Particularly when making changes to
a stable existing program, it provides an efficient way to
restore to previoius bug free versions or to compare the
exisitng code with previous versions for debugging purposes.

Why do you think some version control systems like Git, allow
saving multiple files in one commit, while others like Google
Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is meant for software development projects while systems
like Google Docs are meant for single documents only.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the
history of files?

git log displays the complete history of a commits for a file.
Each commit is asssigned an id. we can use git diff to find
the diff between two commits using their respective IDs.

How might using version control make you more confident to
make changes that could break something?

This would give me a lot of confidence to make bold changes
as I can always revert to a previous working version.
