What happens when you initialize a repository? why do you
need to do it?

When I initialize a repository, a hidden, .git file is
created in the folder with some meta data. I need to 
iniialize the repository in order to commit and track
previous commits for changes i make in my files.

How is the staging area different from the working
directory and the repository? What value do you think it
offer?

The staging area only contains the files added by the 
user, whereas, the working directory and repository 
contains all the files contained in the project. the 
staging area helps separate commits for different files
in a single working directory.
