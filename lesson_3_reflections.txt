Why would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

Remote repositories help in sharing work across different members
of a team working on the same project. It also allows access to
the same project from different machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote
repository?

Manually pulling changes might include commits from other people
that might not be complete

Describe the difference between forks, clones and Branches. When
would you use one instead of the other?

Forks are copies of repositories developed by another person in
to a repository belonging to us on GitHub. Clones are copies of
a repository from GitHub on to our local machines. Clones are
also copies of a local repository on to another location locally.
Branches are different changes to the same code from a certain
point onwards.
